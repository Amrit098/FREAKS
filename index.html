  <h1 style=font-family:Vivaldi;><span style="background-color: orange">Females</span></h1>
  <p style=color:rgb(240,55,200)>Mostly girls are addicted to selfies so obviously there are more female selfies around the web.Though females have problems with selfies, they should not be criticized for it. Females play a great role in our society. Great ideas come from women. If somebody doesn't like their selfies then don't look at them. They are not the only one with problems. Men have their problems too. Behind every man is a woman.</p>

  <h1 style=font-family:Vivaldi;><span style="background-color: orange">Males</span></h1>
  <p style=color:rgb(210,75,150)>Males do not have many problems with selfies because they are always usy with games or their jobs. That is somewhat an advantage. But they have other problems in their life. Yet they are not criticized for it. But in the midst of all of this they forget how they look. Your looks say alot about you.</p>

  <h2 style=font-family:Cursive;><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">REACTION</span></h2>
  <p style=color:rgb(200,110,240)>Society sees this as a disorder because they donot like it. They criticize people who take selfies and call them selfie freaks.Sometimes parents punish their children by taking away their electronical devices. They forget that they were born from a woman. If you don't like to look at something then don't look at it. Don't hurt others just because you are uncomfortable. Solve your own problems before interfering in other people's lives.</p>

  <h2 style=font-family:Cursive;><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Conclusion</span></h2>
  <p style=color:rgb(210,90,140)>People who take selfies should be seen as normal people. Taking selfies is their way of thinking they are pretty.Criticizing them is wrong. Everybody has their own way of doing things. It may be a way of recieving comfort for them or having fun. Some selfies are not appropriate so they should be blocked or taken a stand against but if the selfies are appropriate then nobody has any right to tell you to take it down or anything. Don't abandon yourself because of what others say.</p>
